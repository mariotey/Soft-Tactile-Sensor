# UROP: Soft Tactile Sensors for Human-Computer Interaction and Gaming #

## Description ##
As technology continues to advance, it spurs the growth of technological innovation. One such innovation would be wearable input devices whichc are gaining popularity with the evolution of portable computing and gaming, particularly in the development of Virtual and Augmented Reality. Other than providing navigation, text and control functionalities, these devices are equipped with sensors that possess certain characteristics such as low latency and small form factor. While recent VR gaming devices have done well in providing users with immersive experiences by engaging their visual and auditory senses, the engagement of touch is limited. Moreover, some VR gaming devices can be tedious and time-consuming to set up and specific toward certain applications. 

As such, this project aims to develop a soft, tactile, wearable gaming input device that is easily operable through touch, has low latency and low form factor, and provide users with a pleasant and comfortable gaming experience. The device will allow users to have a more immersive experience with games, while also showcasing the potential of soft tactile sensing in VR gaming applications. The development of capacitive tactile sensors and their application as a wearable keyboard/gaming glove will be explored in this project, along with the design of its circuitry and the prototyping of the gaming gloves. The project will also involve C programming on Arduino with Teensyduino extensions.

By embarking on this project, it hopes to inspire further developments in VR gaming devices to provide users with better immersive gaming experiences. This project aims to be a stepping stone towards the development of VR gaming input devices that improve the immersive gaming experience by showcasing the potential of soft tactile sensing in VR gaming applications.
